✅ The purpose of the scripts is usually to enhance the performance or perform routine tasks for an application.

✅ Server side scripts are interpreted on the server while client side scripts are interpreted by the client application.

⭕ Programming Language Vs Scripting Language

✅ 
    Programming language	                                                    Scripting language
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1. Has all the features needed to develop complete applications.	            Mostly used for routine tasks
2. The code has to be compiled before it can be executed	                    The code is usually executed without compiling
3. Does not need to be embedded into other languages	                        Is usually embedded into other software environments.

⭕ What does PHP stand for?

✅ PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
✅ HTML is an added advantage when learning PHP Language. You can even learn PHP without knowing HTML but it’s recommended you at least know the basics of HTML.
✅ Database management systems DBMS for database powered applications.
✅ For more advanced topics such as interactive applications and web services, you will need JavaScript and XML.

⭕ Why use PHP?

✅  do not need to have PHP installed; only a web browser would be enough.
✅  PHP has in built support for working hand in hand with MySQL
✅  PHP is cross platform; this means you can deploy your application on a number of different operating systems such as windows, Linux, Mac OS etc.

⭕ PHP Data Types, Variables, Constant, Operators Tutorial

🛑 PHP Data Types

✅ A Data type is the classification of data into a category according to its attributes;

        Alphanumeric characters are classified as strings
        Whole numbers are classified integers
        Numbers with decimal points are classified as floating points.
        True or false values are classified as Boolean.

🛑 PHP Variables

✅ All variable names must start with the dollar sign.
✅ The var_dump function is used to determine the data type. 

    Example:

    $a = 1;
    var_dump($a);

    O/p:
    int(1)

🛑 PHP Constant

✅  A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed at runtime.

    Example:

    define(‘PI’,3.14);
